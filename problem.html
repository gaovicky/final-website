          <li>The increase in the amount of eye contact people receive on Zoom
            calls can be stressful. Everyone is looking at each other nonstop.
            Even if you are not the speaker, you are still being stared at.
            This is unnatural because people usually look around when they are
            speaking to someone in person. For example, if you are sitting in a
            classroom, you might glance at the teacher, take notes, and look at
            the board.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>Looking at your reflection can cause you to become more critical
            of yourself. According to Professor Jeremy Bailenson at Stanford
            University, this experience is like another person holding a mirror
            in front of you as you make decisions and give feedback.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>It’s more exhausting to send and receive nonverbal messages
            through videoconferencing than face-to-face interactions. For
            instance, you have to exaggerate a nod or a thumbs up to
            demonstrate that you are agreeing with someone.</li>

          <li>In-person and audio phone calls allow people to be more active.
            However, when your day is filled with video calls, you are often
            stuck in the same seat. It’s not natural for your body to be limited.
            This sedentary behavior will cause you to forget about good posture,
            proper hand and arm positions at your keyboard.</li>
